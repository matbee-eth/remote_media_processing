# Project Tracking Document: Distributed A/V Processing SDK

**Project:** RemoteMediaProcessing SDK  
**Started:** December 2024  
**Current Phase:** Phase 3 - Advanced Remote Code Execution (COMPLETED)  

## Project Status: PHASE 3 COMPLETE WITH AST ANALYSIS âœ…

**Note:** Phase 3 is now complete with CloudPickle-based remote class execution and AST-based dependency packaging. See `PHASE_3_PROJECT_TRACKING.md` for detailed status.

## Historical Status: Phases 1-2 Completed

### Completed Tasks
- [x] Analyzed Development Strategy Document
- [x] Created initial project file structure
- [x] Set up core SDK package structure
- [x] Created placeholder files for main components
- [x] Implemented core Pipeline and Node base classes
- [x] Created basic processing nodes (PassThrough, Buffer, Audio, Video, Transform)
- [x] Set up WebRTC manager foundation (placeholder)
- [x] Implemented serialization utilities
- [x] Created comprehensive test structure
- [x] Set up example applications
- [x] Created CLI interface
- [x] Configured build system (setup.py, pyproject.toml)
- [x] Set up development tools configuration

### File Structure Reasoning

Based on the Development Strategy Document, I've organized the project into the following structure:

1. **Core SDK Package (`remotemedia/`)**: Main SDK package with modular components
2. **Examples**: Demonstration applications for different use cases
3. **Tests**: Comprehensive test suite following pytest conventions
4. **Remote Service**: Docker-based remote execution service
5. **Documentation**: User guides and API documentation
6. **Development Tools**: Scripts and utilities for development

### Key Design Decisions

1. **Package Name**: `remotemedia` - concise and descriptive
2. **Modular Architecture**: Separate modules for pipeline, nodes, webrtc, remote execution
3. **Phase-based Development**: Structure supports incremental development as outlined in strategy
4. **Testing Strategy**: Unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests
5. **Documentation**: Sphinx-based documentation with examples

### Next Steps
- [x] Implement core Pipeline and Node base classes
- [x] Create basic serialization utilities
- [x] Set up WebRTC manager foundation
- [x] Implement first set of local processing nodes
- [x] Create initial test cases
- [x] Create gRPC-enabled Docker system for remote execution
- [x] Create simple remote execution test
- [ ] Implement remote execution integration in Pipeline class
- [ ] Create comprehensive integration tests
- [ ] Set up CI/CD pipeline
- [ ] Begin Phase 3 planning (user-defined code execution)

### Risks and Considerations
- Security implications of remote code execution (addressed in Phase 3)
- Performance optimization for real-time processing
- Cross-platform compatibility
- Dependency management complexity

### Phase 1 Goals (Current)
- Establish robust local pipeline execution framework
- Basic A/V handling capabilities
- WebRTC DataChannel communication
- Simple example applications
- Core serialization utilities
- Unit and integration tests
